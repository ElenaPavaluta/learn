/**
 * O(nLog n)
 * 
 * Merge sort keeps on dividing the list into equal halves until it can no more
 * be divided. By definition, if it is only one element in the list, it is
 * sorted. Then, merge sort combines the smaller sorted lists keeping the new
 * list sorted too.
 * 
 * 
 * Step 1 − if it is only one element in the list it is already sorted, return.
 * 
 * Step 2 − divide the list recursively into two halves until it can no more be
 * divided
 * 
 * Step 3 − merge the smaller lists into new list in sorted order.
