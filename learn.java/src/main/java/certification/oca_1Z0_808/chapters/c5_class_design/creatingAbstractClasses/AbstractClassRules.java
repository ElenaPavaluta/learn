 * 1. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly.

 * 2. Abstract classes may be defined with any number, including zero, of
 * abstract and nonabstract methods.
 * 
 * 
 * 3. Abstract classes may not be marked as private or final.
 * 
 * 
 * 4. An abstract class that extends another abstract class inherits all of its
 * abstract methods as its own abstract methods.
 * 
 * 
 * 5. The first concrete class that extends an abstract class must provide an
 * implementation for all of the inherited abstract methods.
