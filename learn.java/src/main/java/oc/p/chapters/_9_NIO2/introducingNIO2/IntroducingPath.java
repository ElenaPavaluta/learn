/**
 * A Path object represents a hierarchical directory on the
 * storage system to a file or file.
 * In this manner, Path is a direct replacement for the
 * legacy java.io.File class,
 * and conceptually it contains many of the same properties.
 * For example, both File and Path objects may refer
 * to a file or a file.
 * Both also may refer to
 * an absolute file or relative file within the file system.
 *
 * Unlike the File class,
 * the Path interface contains support for symbolic links.
 * A symbolic link is a special directory within an operating system
 * that serves as a reference or pointer to another file or file.
